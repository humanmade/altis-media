The Media module includes features and enhancements related to uploaded media. This includes [lazy loading](./lazy-loading.md), [AI powered image classification](./image-recognition.md) plus [dynamic image manipulation](./dynamic-images.md) and cropping tools.

In addition to the above features there are low-level enhancements including SVG sanitization to mitigate XSS attacks.
